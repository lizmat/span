=head1 DESCRIPTION

NOTE: this distribution has been deprecated in favour of the
L<snip|https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/snip> distribution.

The C<span> distribution exports a single subroutine C<span> that mimics
the functionality provided by L<Haskell's span functionality|https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.16.1.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:span>.

The C<span> subroutine takes a matcher much like C<grep> does, which can
be a C<Callable> or any other object that can have the C<ACCEPTS> method
called on it.
