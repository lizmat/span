NAME

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use span;

.say for span * < 10, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, 7, 13, 9, 6, 2, 20, 4;
# (2 2 2 5 5 7)
# (13 9 6 2 20 4)

.say for span (* < 10, * < 20), 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, 7, 13, 9, 6, 2, 20, 4;
# (2 2 2 5 5 7)
# (13 9 6 2)
# (20 4)

DESCRIPTION
===========

NOTE: this distribution has been deprecated in favour of the [snip](https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/snip) distribution.

The `span` distribution exports a single subroutine `span` that mimics the functionality provided by [Haskell's span functionality](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.16.1.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:span).

The `span` subroutine takes a matcher much like `grep` does, which can be a `Callable` or any other object that can have the `ACCEPTS` method called on it.
